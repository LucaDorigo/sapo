  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nSapo is a C++ tool for the formal analysis of discrete-time polynomial dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nThe problems treated by Sapo are:\r\n* Reachability computation, i.e., the calculation of the set of states reachable by the system from a set of initial conditions\r\n* Parameter synthesis, i.e., the refinement of a set of parameters so that the system satisfies a given specification. For reachability analysis Sapo produces a flowpipe that over-approximates the set of states reachable by the system from a set of initial conditions.\r\n\r\nFor parameter synthesis Sapo computes a refinement of the given set of parameters such that the system satisfies a given specification. The specification is formalized as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the analysis can be done on bounded time.\r\n\r\n### Models\r\n\r\nThe dynamical systems supported by Sapo are discrete-time polynomial dynamical systems, i.e., dynamical systems whose evolutions can be described by difference equations of the form x_{k+1} = f(x_k,p)\r\n\r\nReachability computation can be carried out also on systems without parameters whose dynamics look like x_{k+1} = f(x_k) with f : R^n to R^n polynomial.\r\n\r\n### Set representation\r\n\r\nThe flowpipe representing the reachable set consists in a series of sets. The sets supported by Sapo are:\r\n* Boxes (or hyperrectangles), i.e., n-dimensional rectangles\r\n* Parallelotopes, i.e., n-dimensional parallelograms\r\n* Parallelotopes bundles, i.e., finite sets of parallelotopes whose intersections generate polytopes\r\n\r\nThe parameter synthesis produces a refined set of parameters represented by:\r\n* Polytopes, i.e., n-dimensional polygon\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nSapo is implemented in C++. Thus, a C++ compiler is required.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Sapo relies on two external libraries:\r\n* GiNaC (GiNaC is Not a CAS), for the symbolic manipulation of polynomials\r\n* GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit), for solving linear programming problems\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nSapo is maintained as a GitHub repository at the address https://github.com/tommasodreossi/sapo.git\r\n\r\nIt can be obtained either by typing the shell command:\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/tommasodreossi/sapo.git\r\n\r\nor by downloading the ZIP archive at https://github.com/tommasodreossi/sapo.git\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nTo install from the source type:\r\n    $ make This creates a binary called sapo in /bin\r\n\r\nTo run Sapo, move to /bin and launch the binary with the command:\r\n    $ ./sapo\r\n\r\n### Visualization\r\n\r\n2D/3D or projections of higher dimensional reachable and parameter sets computed by Sapo can be visualized using the Matlab package plotregion.",
