  "body": "#Description\r\n\r\nSapo is a C++ tool for the formal analysis of discrete-time polynomial dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nThe problems treated by Sapo are:\r\n* Reachability computation, i.e., the calculation of the set of states reachable by the system from a set of initial conditions\r\n* Parameter synthesis, i.e., the refinement of a set of parameters so that the system satisfies a given specification.\r\n\r\nFor reachability analysis Sapo produces a flowpipe that over-approximates the set of states reachable by the system from a set of initial conditions.\r\n\r\nFor parameter synthesis Sapo computes a refinement of the given set of parameters such that the system satisfies a given specification. The specification is formalized as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the analysis can be done on bounded time.\r\n",
